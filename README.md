Component Required:

1x Arduino UNO

1x Arduino Motor Shield

1x 3 Way Switch

2x 1kΩ Resitence

2x Led (i used green/red)

2x Resitence 220 Ω(for led)

Assembly passage:

1)First connect the arduino-motor-shield on the arduino UNO

2)Load the code on the arduino

3)Connect the 3way stich pin to the breadboard in separate 3 diffrent pin

4)Connect the left Pin switch to a line empty and here put the 1kΩ Resitence to GND

5)Connect the right Pin switch to a line empty and here put the 1kΩ Resitence to GND

6)Connect the middle pin to vcc

7)Put a simple wire before the 1kΩ Resitence in the left pin line and connect it to the arduino pin7

8)Put a simple wire before the 1kΩ Resitence in the lright pin line and connect it to the arduino pin6

9)Connect the Led with the Resitence on the breadboard and then connect it to the arduino pin 5 the other led on pin 4

10)Connect the motor to the channel A on arduino 

11)Power the board and try it
